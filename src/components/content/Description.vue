          <p class="text-white text-justify">The Ordina Delay Predictor is a software that uses Artificial Intelligence to predict whether there will be a delay or not on the selected route. It uses national train data of the Netherlands and includes the six most important cities in the country, Groningen, Den Haag, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Rotterdam. It is simple to use, at it requires only the cities of departure and arrival and the date of travel, and based on the past year data it will predict whether there is a high change or low change of a delay at that time on that route.</p>
